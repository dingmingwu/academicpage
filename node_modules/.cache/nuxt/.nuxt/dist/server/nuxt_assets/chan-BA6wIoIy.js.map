However, LDV is computationally demanding. Therefore, existing exact solutions are not scalable (or even not feasible) to support large-scale datasets and high resolution sizes for generating LDV. To handle the efficiency issues, we develop the first solution to approximately compute LDV with an 𝜖-relative error guarantee, which consists of two main parts. First, we develop the new indexing structure, called length-aggregation-based grid structure (LARGE). Second, based on LARGE, we develop two types of fast bound functions, namely (1) square-shaped lower and upper bound functions and (2) arbitrary-shaped lower and upper bound functions, which can filter a large portion of unnecessary computations. By theoretically analyzing the tightness of our bound functions and experimentally comparing our solution with existing exact solutions on four large-scale datasets, we demonstrate that our solution can be scalable to generate high-resolution LDVs using large-scale datasets. In particular, our solution achieves up to 291.8x speedups over the state-of-the-art solutions. </p>\n        <div style=\"display: flex;\" class=\"gimgs\">\n          <div class=\"image-container\" data-text=\"Click to view\">\n            <el-image :src=\"`/academicpage/image/pro1_1.png`\" fit=\"cover\" alt=\"\" class=\"gimg1\" :preview-src-list=\"['/academicpage/image/pro1_1.png']\"/>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"image-container\" data-text=\"Click to view\">\n            <el-image :src=\"`/academicpage/image/pro1_2.png`\" fit=\"cover\" alt=\"\" class=\"gimg2\" :preview-src-list=\"['/academicpage/image/pro1_2.png']\"/>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"group2\">\n        <p class=\"gtitle\">LION: Fast and High-Resolution Network Kernel Density Visualization</p>\n        <p class=\"gintro\">Network Kernel Density Visualization (NKDV) has often been used in a wide range of applications, e.g., criminology, transportation science, and urban planning. However, NKDV is computationally expensive, which cannot be scalable to large-scale datasets and high resolution sizes. Although a recent work, called aggregate distance augmentation (ADA), has been developed for improving the efficiency to generate NKDV, this method is still slow and does not take the resolution size into account for optimizing the efficiency. In this paper, we develop a new solution, called LION, which can reduce the worst-case time complexity for generating high-resolution NKDV, without increasing the space complexity. Experiment results on four large-scale location datasets verify that LION can achieve 2.86x to 35.36x speedup compared with the stateof-the-art ADA method. </p>\n        <div style=\"display: flex;\" class=\"gimgs\">\n          <div class=\"image-container\" data-text=\"Click to view\">\n            <el-image :src=\"`/academicpage/image/pro2_1.png`\" fit=\"cover\" alt=\"\" class=\"gimg1\" :preview-src-list=\"['/academicpage/image/pro2_1.png']\"/>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"image-container\" data-text=\"Click to view\">\n            <el-image :src=\"`/academicpage/image/pro2_2.png`\" fit=\"cover\" alt=\"\" class=\"gimg2\" :preview-src-list=\"['/academicpage/image/pro2_2.png']\"/>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div v-if=\"showGroup2\" class=\"group3\">\n        <p class=\"gtitle\">Fast Network K-function-based Spatial Analysis</p>\n        <p class=\"gintro\">Network K-function has been the de facto operation for analyzing point patterns in spatial networks, which is widely used in many communities, including geography, ecology, transportation science, social science, and criminology. To analyze a location dataset, domain experts need to generate a network K-function plot that involves computing multiple network K-functions. However, network K-function is a computationally expensive operation that is not feasible to support large-scale datasets, let alone to generate a network K-function plot. To handle this issue, we develop two efficient algorithms, namely count augmentation (CA) and neighbor sharing (NS), which can reduce the worst-case time complexity for computing network K-functions. In addition, we incorporate the advanced shortest path sharing (ASPS) approach into these two methods to further lower the worst-case time complexity for generating network K-function plots. Experiment results on four large-scale location datasets (up to 7.33 million data points) show that our methods can achieve up to 165.85x speedup compared with the state-of-the-art methods. </p>\n        <div style=\"display: flex;\" class=\"gimgs\">\n          <div class=\"image-container\" data-text=\"Click to view\">\n            <el-image :src=\"`/academicpage/image/pro3_1.png`\" fit=\"cover\" alt=\"\" class=\"gimg1\" :preview-src-list=\"['/academicpage/image/pro3_1.png']\"/>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"image-container\" data-text=\"Click to view\">\n            <el-image :src=\"`/academicpage/image/pro3_2.png`\" fit=\"cover\" alt=\"\" class=\"gimg2\" :preview-src-list=\"['/academicpage/image/pro3_2.png']\"/>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"image-container\" data-text=\"Click to view\">\n            <el-image :src=\"`/academicpage/image/pro3_3.png`\" fit=\"cover\" alt=\"\" class=\"gimg3\" :preview-src-list=\"['/academicpage/image/pro3_3.png']\"/>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div v-if=\"showGroup2\" class=\"group4\">\n        <p class=\"gtitle\">SLAM: Efficient Sweep Line Algorithms for Kernel Density Visualization</p>\n        <p class=\"gintro\">Kernel Density Visualization (KDV) has been extensively used in a wide range of applications, including traffic accident hotspot detection, crime hotspot detection, disease outbreak detection, and ecological modeling. However, KDV is a computationally expensive operation, which is not scalable to large datasets (e.g., million-scale data points) and high resolution sizes (e.g., 1920 × 1080). To significantly improve the efficiency for generating KDV, we develop two efficient Sweep Line AlgorithMs (SLAM), which can theoretically reduce the time complexity for generating KDV. By incorporating the resolution-aware optimization (RAO) into SLAM, we can further achieve the lowest time complexity for generating KDV. Our extensive experiments on four large-scale real datasets (up to 4.33 million data points) show that all our methods can achieve one to two-order-of-magnitude speedup in many test cases and efficiently support KDV with exploratory operations (e.g., zooming and panning) compared with the state-of-the-art solutions.</p>\n        <div style=\"display: flex;\" class=\"gimgs\">\n          <div class=\"image-container\" data-text=\"Click to view\">\n            <el-image :src=\"`/academicpage/image/pro4_1.png`\" fit=\"cover\" alt=\"\" class=\"gimg1\" :preview-src-list=\"['/academicpage/image/pro4_1.png']\"/>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"image-container\" data-text=\"Click to view\">\n            <el-image :src=\"`/academicpage/image/pro4_2.png`\" fit=\"cover\" alt=\"\" class=\"gimg2\" :preview-src-list=\"['/academicpage/image/pro4_2.png']\"/>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <p style=\"display: flex; margin-top: 24px; height: 30px; line-height: 30px; color: #2F81FC; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px;\">\n        <button class=\"toggle-button\" @click=\"toggleGroup2\" >\n            {{ showGroup2 ?
